## Purpose
Perform data analysis on the data set that was collected in the previous challenge when we scraped Belgian real estate listings from Immoweb.

## Objectives
   - Be able to use pandas.
   - Be able to use Data visualisation libraries.(matplotlib or seaborn)
   - Be able to clean a dataset for analysis
   - Be able to establish conclusions about a dataset.
   - Be able to find and answer creative questions about data
   - Be able to think outside the box


## Why
We are analyzing this data for a fictitious real estate company who wants to create a machine learning model to make price predictions on real estate sales in Belgium.

## How
### Step 1: Data cleaning
    No duplicates
    No blank spaces (ex: " I love python " => "I love python")
    No errors
    No empty values

### Step 2: Data analysis
    Which variable is the target ?
    How many rows and columns ?
    What is the correlation between the variables and the target ? (Why might that be?)
    What is the correlation between the variables and the other variables ? (Why?)
    Which variables have the greatest influence on the target ?
    Which variables have the least influence on the target ?
    How many qualitative and quantitative variables are there ? How would you transform these values into numerical values ?
    Percentage of missing values per column ?

### Step 3: Data interpretation
    Are there any outliers? If yes, which ones and why?
    Which variables would you delete and why ?
    In your opinion, which 5 variables are the most important and why?
    What are the most expensive municipalities in Belgium? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
    What are the most expensive municipalities in Wallonia? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
    What are the most expensive municipalities in Flanders? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
    What are the less expensive municipalities in Belgium? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
    What are the less expensive municipalities in Wallonia? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
    What are the less expensive municipalities in Flanders? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
